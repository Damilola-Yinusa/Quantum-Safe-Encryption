# Quantum-Safe Encryption

## Overview
This Python application implements quantum-safe encryption algorithms to secure data against future quantum computing threats. It includes traditional cryptography using AES and post-quantum cryptography using lattice-based and hash-based algorithms.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quantum_safe_encryption.git
    cd quantum_safe_encryption
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required libraries:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Command-Line Interface (CLI)

To encrypt or decrypt a file using the command-line interface:

```bash
python app.py encrypt traditional input.txt output.enc
python app.py decrypt traditional output.enc decrypted.txt
```

Replace `traditional` with `lattice` or `hash` to use lattice-based or hash-based cryptography respectively.

### Graphical User Interface (GUI)

To use the graphical user interface:

```bash
python gui.py
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to select files and encryption methods.

## Testing

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

This will run all the tests in the `tests` directory and output the results.

## Algorithms

### Traditional Cryptography
- **AES:** A widely used encryption standard for securing data.

### Post-Quantum Cryptography
- **Lattice-Based:** Kyber (using `pqcrypto` library)
- **Hash-Based:** SPHINCS+ (assuming a custom implementation or appropriate library)
